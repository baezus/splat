## what?


## why?


## user stories

### essential

after downloading the app, there should be few barriers to a first conversation

rather than have an abundance of filters and choice-narrowing, i want a filterlessness. the end goal is to make conversation more an arbiter of personal difference.

messages should populate synchronously and in real time

websockets `socket.io` will create the full duplex TCP stream we're looking for, and simple React will create the frontend while the backend is done in relatively vanilla Node.js 

### far off

users should be able to determine the degree of protection they feel they need

users should have their chat history on an auto-archival cycle every 24 hours.
